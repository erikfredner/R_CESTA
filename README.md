# Intro to R for CESTA
A one-hour introduction to text mining in R for the summer research internship at [CESTA](https://cesta.stanford.edu).

The lesson results in a sentiment analysis of a small corpus, currently the last eight US State of the Union addresses.

## Setup
Participants need to install two pieces of free software:

1. [The R language and interpreter](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/).
2. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), an integrated developer environment for R.

The lesson also depends on several R packages such as [`tm`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html), which we will install as we go.
